Twelve [AOC](https://adventofcode.com) challenges in twelve different languages.

## Languages

At present, the list of languages is as follows:

1. C++
2. Rust
3. Go
4. Java
5. C#
6. F#
7. Haskell
8. Scala
9. Elixir
10. TypeScript
11. Clojure
12. Python

The idea is to move from low-level to high-level, while keeping a bias towards functional languages.

## Running the code

Check the READMEs in the various dirs.
