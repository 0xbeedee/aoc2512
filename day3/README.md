## Running the code

**Prerequisites:** You need Rust and Cargo installed. Get them from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

**Build and run:**
```bash
cargo build    # Compiles the project
cargo run      # Builds and runs the program
```

**Run in release mode (optimized):**
```bash
cargo run --release
```

**Clean up:**
```bash
cargo clean    # Removes compiled files and build artifacts
```

The project uses the Rust 2021 edition and compiles the library (`lib.rs`) and binary (`main.rs`).
