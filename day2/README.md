## Running the code

**Prerequisites:** You need a C++ compiler (like `g++`) and `make` installed.

**Build and run:**
```bash
make        # Compiles the source files (main.cpp, lib.cpp) into an executable
./main      # Runs the program
```

**Clean up:**
```bash
make clean  # Removes compiled files and executables
```

The Makefile compiles with `-Wall -Wextra` (all warnings) and `-std=c++17` (C++17 standard).
